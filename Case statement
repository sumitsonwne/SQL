CASE statement in SQL is used when you need to apply conditional logic within your queries. It allows you to perform actions based on specific conditions

select column1,column2,
case
when salary > 70000 then 'high'
when salary between 40000 and 60000 then 'Medium'
else 'low'
end as  newname
from tablename
